# Calibration-of-Keyes-KY-039-Sensor
Keyes KY-039 is a low cost heartbeat sensor. Unfortunately the output doesn't provide any specific heart rate value, it only shows some peaks which varies w.r.t time depending on the blood flow through the fingers. 
In this project an attempt has been done to calibrate the sensor.
Different volunteers of different age group are used to generate a relation between the generated peaks and the actual heart rate. 
The code can determine the real heart rate with moderate accuracy.
